# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
 
Project Description
    - Refactor the CSS and HTMl in the file given to me in such a way that the function of the website remains intact. Only functionally changing a broken link, to make it link properly. At the same time, eliminate redundancies and add semantic HTML elements so that the site is more adherant to accessability standards and easier for the next programmer to read. The original file had multiple instances of redundant code classes and used exclusively <div> elements for sectioning.

My Experience
    - Overall this project went well for me. Initially I had some confusion about whether we were expected to improve the CSS in ways that would change the functional display of some of the elements but that was cleared up with a TA. I learned about the importance of proper semantic HTML as it relates to user friendliness and accessibility standards. I also learned how to reduce some redundancy while refactoring code to make it both more efficient, and more readable.
